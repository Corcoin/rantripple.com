I have established a way to assign people to your local network and supply them with internet access. Let's say you have a phone. You can use your hotspot to connect to your laptop, smart TV, or any other device using Telnet or Microsoft Remote Desktop, or the client software provided by Rantripple. Once you have the IP address, you are on the web. You can then turn off your hotspot, and you will still be connected to Rantripple.

The virtual mesh network is a whole other ball game. This can be deployed by businesses, internet companies, IoT, military drone swarmsâ€”the applications are endless.
